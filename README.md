# Java Basics – Foundation Practice

This repository contains my structured practice of Java programming
fundamentals, organized topic-wise.

The goal is to build a strong base in core Java concepts before moving
to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

- Input / Output  
- Conditional Statements (if-else)  
- Loops

Each topic is placed in its own folder with multiple practice programs
and a README file describing that folder.
